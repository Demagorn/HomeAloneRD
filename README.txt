1.
Since there is no information regarding the source of the input there must be a validation for the input
data. It can be ether wrong type data or non-possible manipulation that can cause a crash of the function.

2. Initial assumed that i've been told on this assignment that the input function is a valid one will not crush me.
There is no limitation on using additional functions so its @wraps and not "func.__name__ = wrapper.__name__"
