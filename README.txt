Since there is no information regarding the source of the input there must be a validation for the input
data. It can be ether wrong type data or non-possible manipulation that can cause a crash of the function.

2. Initial assumed that i've been told on this assignment that the input function is a valid one will not crush me.
In case there were any doubts i would check the function for valid input. In any case the using an "eval" method
must be done with caution since .sys commands can be passed through.
